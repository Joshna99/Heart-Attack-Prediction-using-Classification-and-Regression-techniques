# Heart-Attack-Prediction-using-Classification-and-Regression-techniques
## Introduction
This project is aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters. It involves data analysis, data preprocessing, and the application of machine learning models to make predictions.
## Parameters considered for the project
    - 'age': Age of the patient.
    - 'sex': Gender of the patient.
    - 'cp': Chest pain type.
    - 'trtbps': Resting blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - 'chol': Cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - 'exng': Exercise-induced angina.
    - 'fbs': Fasting blood sugar level.
    - 'restecg': Resting electrocardiographic results.
    - 'thalachh': Maximum heart rate achieved.
    - 'slp': Slope.
    - 'caa': Number of major vessels.
    - 'thall': Thallium stress test result.
    - 'output': Target variable (0 for less chance of heart attack, 1 for more chance of heart attack).    
## Description of the Project
    This project aims to identify early indicators of heart disease by analyzing various health parameters. It involves data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides valuable insights into the dataset, enabling us to make informed decisions regarding feature selection and model training.

The feature selection process involves considering parameters with significant influence on heart disease prediction and handling multicollinearity to ensure model accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the machine learning models' performance.
